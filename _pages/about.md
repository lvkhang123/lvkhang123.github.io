Hello, my name is Khang Ly. 

I recently earned a Bachelor of Science in Physics, from <a href='https://www.gmu.edu/'>George Mason University</a>, with a minor in Psychology, concentrating on neuroscience. My academic path reflects a deep and ongoing passion for exploring the intersection of complex systems and human cognition - a convergence of physics, neuroscience, and mathematics that continually fuels my curiosity. 

Currently, I am engaged in a collaborative research project with faculty in the <a href='https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/physics-and-astronomy-department'>Physics and Astronomy Department </a>, investigating nonlinear dynamical systems. Our focus is on modeling spiking and bursting behavior in neurons using the Rulkov map, with an emphasis on uncovering the fractal structures and chaotic dynamics that emerge under specific parameter conditions. 

In parallel, I contribute to a neuroscience research initiative within the Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience group in the <a href='https://psychology.gmu.edu/'>Department of Psychology</a>. My responsibilities include data analysis of brain functional connectivity and dynamic activity, using fMRI and TMS datasets to better understanding cogntivie processes. 

Outside of research, I participate in <a href='https://megl.science.gmu.edu/outreach/'>outreach</a> efforts through the <a href='https://megl.science.gmu.edu/about-the-lab/'>Mason Experimental Geometry Lab</a>, where I help introduce young students to the beauty and creativity of mathematics through engaging, hands-on activities. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and playing badminton. As I prepare to pursue the MSc in Physics, I look forward to deepening my engagement with interdisciplinary research at the nexus of brain science and complex systems. 

<b>Research</b> interests: complex systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, neuroscience
